                <p class='text-muted text-left'> Energetic hangout offering light cafe fare and desserts, plus an outdoor garden with hanging lanterns. Overall, a nice place to take the family. While most might think that Prithvi Theatre only hosts plays and that you can't visit it for anything else, let us take this opportunity to prove you wrong and introduce you to Prithvi Cafe situated right outside in the same compound. We can't begin to tell you how beautiful Prithvi Cafe is. You probably already have it all figured out. But we cannot stop ourselves from feeling overwhelmed every time we visit this dreamy place. Prithvi cafe and theatre is a place where the artists are celebrated, apart from serving some delicious food, kadak cutting chai and its famous Irish coffee </p>

                <p> The film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War – Part 2, but Marvel later removed this title. The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and McFeely signing on to write the script a month later. The film serves as a conclusion to the story of the MCU up to that point, ending the story arcs for several main characters. The plot revisits several moments from earlier films, bringing back actors and settings from throughout the franchise, as well as music from previous films. Filming began in August 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, shooting back-to-back with Infinity War, and ended in January 2018. Additional filming took place in the Metro and Downtown Atlanta areas, New York state, Scotland, and England. The official title was revealed in December 2018. With an estimated budget of $356–400 million, the film is one of the most expensive films ever made.</p>

            <p class='list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12 '> Once revolutionary, then a ubiquitous material, plastic is increasingly being shunned due to the lasting harm its chemical components do to the planet.

                As a result, Lego has vowed that its iconic bricks will be 100 percent sustainable by 2030.

                With pieces that are virtually unbreakable and reusable for generations, Lego—whose name is a contraction in Danish for "Leg Godt" or "Play Well"—has always had sustainability as a leitmotiv, Tim Brooks, head of corporate responsibility, told AFP.

                Now, the company just has to adapt to environmental and consumer demands.

                A study by the NPD market research group showed that 47 percent of Christmas shoppers worldwide chose not to buy a toy due to sustainability concerns.

                "Toy manufacturers are really embracing this topic... There's a lot of innovation in both packaging and material for toys," Frederique Tutt, a toy industry expert at NPD, told AFP.

                Lego, based in the western Danish town of Billund, has no plans to abandon plastic. Rather, it aims to improve on the materials it uses.</p>

            <img src="artic_bird.jpeg" class='img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12'>
            <p class='list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12 '> OA drastic drop in caribou and shorebird populations is a reflection of the dire changes unfolding on the Arctic tundra, according to a new report from the Arctic Council.

                The terrestrial Arctic spans approximately 2.7m sq miles (7m sq km), marked by extreme cold, drought, strong winds and seasonal darkness. Species living in this environment have adapted to thrive in the harsh conditions. But the climate crisis has upended such survival strategies, according to the State of the Arctic Terrestrial Biodiversity report, published by the council’s Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (Caff) working group.

                “Climate change is the overwhelming driver of change in terrestrial Arctic ecosystems, causing diverse, unpredictable and significant impacts that are expected to intensify,” the report says.

                The Arctic is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the world, leading to extreme weather events, southerly species moving northward, and the emergence and spread of pathogens among native species. The report, released on Thursday at the council’s ministerial meeting in Reykjavik, is the first to assess the status and trends for Arctic species living on land, following Caff’s 2017 assessment of marine biodiversity.</p>
